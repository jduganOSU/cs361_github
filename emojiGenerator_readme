Emoji Generator Microservice

To make a request to the emoji generator, use the url '*/fetch_emoji?name={desired emoji}'. The URL will return a json object that 
looks something like this: '{"emoji": "\ud83c\udfb8" }'.

To recieve data from the emoji generator, you first need to make the request (using the requests library) as stated earlier. Then, you use the key 'emoji' to get the emoji itself. 
Heres an example: 

import requests
emoji_name = microphone
url = f'http://{url to microservice}/fetch_emoji?name={emoji_name}'
emoji = requests.get(url).json()
print(emoji['emoji'])


The above will print the microphone emoji. 

The emoji generator makes use of this api: https://api-ninjas.com/api/emoji
